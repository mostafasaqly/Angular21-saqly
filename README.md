## 7. Routing (Updated) 
# Angular Routing Demo (v21)

This folder contains a **complete routing playground** that follows the official
[`angular.dev/guide/routing`](https://angular.dev/guide/routing) topics and shows
them all in a single demo app.

The goal is to use it in teaching / live sessions:
students can open the app and *see* every routing feature working, then open the
corresponding file and compare it with the documentation.

---

## Tech stack

- **Angular v21** (standalone APIs)
- **Router v21** with:
  - `provideRouter(...)`
  - `withComponentInputBinding`
  - `withInMemoryScrolling`
  - `withPreloading(PreloadAllModules)`
  - `withRouterConfig`
  - `withViewTransitions`

---

## How to run

```bash
npm install
ng serve
ng test
# open http://localhost:4200

## 8. Forms (Updated) 
# Angular Forms Demo (v21)

This project demonstrates the different form capabilities in **Angular 21**, including the new **Signal-Based Forms API**, classic Reactive Forms, Typed Reactive Forms, Template-driven Forms, and Dynamic Forms using `FormArray`.

The demo provides a clean tab-based UI for switching between the different examples:

---

## 📌 Available Demo Views

### 1. **Signal Forms**
Located in: `signal-login-form.component.ts`  
- Uses Angular 21's new **signal-based forms** API.  
- Fully reactive without zones.  
- Uses `form()`, `Field`, validators, and `submit()`.  
- Demonstrates validation and control flow (`@if`, `@switch`) in templates.

---

### 2. **Reactive Forms**
Located in: `reactive-profile-form.component.ts`  
- Demonstrates the classic **Reactive Forms API** (`FormGroup`, `FormControl`).  
- Includes validation and value changes tracking.  
- Foundation for most enterprise Angular applications.

---

### 3. **Strictly Typed Reactive Forms**
Located in: `typed-order-form.component.ts`  
- Shows the typed version of reactive forms introduced recently.  
- Strong typing → fewer runtime errors & better autocomplete.

---

### 4. **Template-driven Forms**
Located in: `template-contact-form.component.ts`  
- Standard Angular template-driven approach using `ngModel`.  
- Suitable for simple, small-scale forms.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Forms (Reactive FormArray)**
Located in: `dynamic-survey-form.component.ts`  
- Demonstrates building forms dynamically from configuration.  
- Useful for surveys, dynamic UI building, and admin panels.

---

### 6. **Dynamic Input Forms (Add/Remove Inputs at Runtime)**
Located in: `DynamicInputDemo.component.ts`  
- Uses `FormArray` to add/remove inputs dynamically.  
- Each input has its own validation.  
- Uses Angular v21 template features:  
  - `@for` for looping  
  - `@if` for conditional rendering  
  - Tracking by the form control itself (`track item`) for stable DOM updates

Example behavior:
- Click **+** to add a new input  
- Click **–** to remove a specific input  
- Cannot accidentally delete the wrong field thanks to stable tracking  
- Automatically updates JSON output below the form

---

## 🧭 Navigation Component

The main navigation exists in:



Signal Forms examples are inside the Signals folder.

---

## 9. HTTP Client --
1. GET – Fetch list of posts

Uses HttpClient.get()

Handles loading, error states, and signals

Supports query params (_limit=10)

Renders list using @for

Files:
http-list.component.ts, http-demo.service.ts

2. POST – Create new post

Reactive Form

Sends data with POST

Disables button while submitting

Displays server JSON response

File: http-create.component.ts

3. PUT / PATCH – Edit post

Inline edit mode

Updates using PUT

UI updates instantly without reloading

Files:
http-list.component.ts → saveEdit()
http-demo.service.ts → updatePost()

4. DELETE – Remove post

Confirmation dialog

Removes from UI immediately

Uses HttpClient.delete()

Component: delete handler inside http-list.component.ts

5. httpResource – Reactive data fetching

Modern reactive data API (Angular 17+):

resource = inject(HttpClient).resource<Post[]>({
  url: 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts'
});


File: http-resource-demo.component.ts

6. Logging Interceptor

Logs every request:

Method

URL

Status

Duration

Registered in app.config.ts:

provideHttpClient(withInterceptors([loggingInterceptor]))


File: logging.interceptor.ts

7. Apidog Mock API Integration

Mock backend replacing jsonplaceholder for testing.

Supports:

GET /posts?limit=10

POST /posts

PUT /posts/:id

DELETE /posts/:id

File: apiDog.service.ts
Component: http-list-apidog.component.ts

## 📌 Notes
- Folders are organized based on the Angular Documentation structure.  
- Each chapter aligns with real Angular v21 features and best practices.  
- You can extend the repo with Routing, HTTP, State Management, Tailwind, or Angular ARIA demos at any time.

## 🎯 Goal of This Repository
This repo serves as a practical, hands-on learning path for Angular 21 — following the exact order of the official Angular docs, but with real examples, simplified explanations, and clean project organization.
